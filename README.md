# AfterSteamOsUpdate

## Explanation

If you have a steam deck and the steam deck gets a new update, all packages with pacman or software that is not flatpak will be deleted.
Thats why I wrote this simple script to quickly reinstall the software.

## How It works
- Before you run this script you need to set a sudo password or switch to the root user.
  - You can set a sudo password by executing the command "passwd".
       
- You just need to run the install-packages.sh file in your terminal.
  - Then you only have to specify which packages you want to install and just click through the questions that were asked.
